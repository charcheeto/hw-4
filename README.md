# Answer to HW 4 Question 6

## Why did I choose this question

The reason why I chose the question:

>Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?

Is because when I usually go on a plane, I don't recline my seat *only* because I think it is a hastle. Reclining your seat doesn't seem rude to me **BUT** I think if you recline your seat super far back then you're rude to me. I mostly think that if someone was to recline their seat in front of me and it was super fat back, then I would be really upset and not enjoy my flight which then would make me not really enjoy my trip; I don't want that to happen.

## What was interesting about the chart?

Something I found interesting about the chart was that a lot of people answered that it wasn't rude to recline your seat at all, **BUT** it then makes me ask a second question of how much recline can one do before people start saying *"Yes, it is rude"*

The chart I will provide right here:

![Is it rude to recline your seat chart](data_wrapper)

Shows that:

>502 people said No it wasn't rude at all
>>281 people said Yes somewhat
>>>71 people said Yes it was very rude
